    { from: "Yuri", msg: "Dear my KaoJaneJaneKao,\n\nI believe that to be at this stage of career and lifepath, you both have been through a lot, with ups and downs, gloomy days when everything felt too heavy, when giving up seemed easier than moving forward. But somehow, you still managed to overcome it all, right?\n\nThat's where I find myself now.\n\nThis 4th quarter has been one of the hardest chapters of my year. Nothing seems to be going the right way. Even though I tried to prepare myself for the worst, reality still hit harder than expected and completely shook me. And then, in the middle of all that, I found you both.\n\nI happened to come across Love Design Series when it had just aired episode 2. At first, it caught my attention because of P'Kao and the artistic filming angles. But little by little, I found myself falling for Janeyeh as well your cuteness, your character analysis, and the effort you put into every scene truly touched me. At that time, I already read the novel, but I was still so eager to see how KaoJane would bring the story to life. And it did not disappoint at all. The chemistry is simply too good.\n\nFrom that moment on, Thursdays became something I looked forward to again. The series, the small moments, the trends you shared, the way you interacted with fans on X, all of it genuinely made my weeks brighter.\n\nThen, the fan screening and fan meeting were announced. It felt like a universe message, they happened on the same day as my crush's wedding. So, thank you for having those events on those days hehe I did skip the wedding (I really didn't wanna go), flew to Bangkok, and chose to see you both instead. And surprisingly, I wasn't as upset as I thought I would be, because I was on cloud nine thanks to you guys.\n\nThank you truly, for healing my heart. You guys, KaoJaneJanekao is like a small but powerful light at the end of a very dark tunnel. I do hope that you'll continue accompanying each other in the future, not only through movie projects, but also in life" },
    { from: "9779s", msg: "Hello KaoJane – JaneKao,\n\nI’m a fan from Vietnam 🇻🇳 who has loved and supported you both since the very first days of Love Design. I’m already in my late 20s, and honestly, I’ve never followed any Thai girl-love couples before.\n\nI knew Kao through her previous TV projects and had followed some of her activities before. As for Janeeyeh, I only got to know her through the MV you acted in together and then Love Design. But it was truly your amazing acting that completely convinced me — and many other very picky GL fans — to say “wow.” You were just that outstanding.\n\nFrom that moment on, I decided to become a loyal fan of KaoJane, and I’d love to walk alongside you for a long time and go very far together.\n\nI wasn’t able to attend the recent fancon, and I was really sad and regretful about that. But I hope that when you read this letter — along with many, many other letters from Vietnamese fans 🇻🇳 — you’ll understand just how much the KaoJane / JaneKao Vietnam fandom truly loves you and how much we wish to meet you one day in our beautiful, warm, and welcoming Vietnam.\n\nThank you for bringing such a fresh and meaningful perspective to the girl-love genre. Thank you for the life lessons, the beautiful messages, and the sincerity you’ve shared with us, the 9779s. After 30 years, I can proudly say that I’m a member of “9779s.”\n\nLastly, I want to wish you both good health. Please keep holding hands and walking together for a long, long journey ahead. I hope our fandom will continue to grow strong and be a source of comfort and support for one another.\n\nWishing KaoJane – JaneKao a peaceful, joyful, and warm Christmas.\nI love you, 9779." },

    { from: "ichaseko", msg: "Xin chao p’Kao,\n\nI’ve been thinking for a while about how to start this letter. I’m not very good with words, nor do i know how to write beautifully, but i still really wanted to write to you. I’m your international fan, sorry that i can’t write in Thai. I truly hope you can understand my feelings through these words.\n\nI don’t usually watch many Thai dramas, so I only got to know you recently through Love Design. I’m sorry it took me so long to find you, but honestly, i fell in love with you at first sight.\n\nBeyond your beauty, you are the first and only actress so far who has truly won my heart with acting skills alone. I deeply love the way you act with your eyes. Even when i’m not the character of a scene, you still help me fully understand the emotions of the character. You are genuinely talented, and you are truly amazing.\n\nI also know that there was a time when you were unwell, which you shared through your Instagram posts. Yet, you still chose to continue filming without asking for any delays because you didn’t want to affect the production schedule. Even after going to the hospital, you returned to work. I know that period must have been very difficult for you. I went through a health condition quite similar to yours, so I truly understand how hard it can be. Knowing this made me admire you even more — not only for your professionalism, but also for your strong sense of responsibility and dedication.\n\nSeeing how you’ve gone through many challenges but still managed to maintain such a strong mindset and warm energy truly inspires me. I also notice how caring you are toward others, how you always try to take care of the people around you. But sometimes, i feel like you forget to take care of yourself. I know you tend to overthink, and I understand that, cause i’m also someone who overthinks a lot. I know how draining that can be. So I just hope you’ll think more about yourself, trust yourself more, and be a little kinder to your own heart. You’re already doing so well.\n\nBy the way, we’re the same height, p’Kao. But I saw your story the other day and noticed that you only weigh 42 kg — even lighter than me, though I’m already quite thin. I know you exercise a lot, but I still hope you'll eat well and rest properly too. You’re really very thin, p’Kao. Please take good care of yourself, okay naaa.\n\nActually, I’ve always been someone who tends to see things in a negative way. But after watching your interviews and learning about your mindset, something slowly changed inside me. Your way of thinking brought a gentle but positive energy into my thoughts. You helped me look at myself again, and learn to love and appreciate myself a little more. Even though the time i’ve liked you can only be counted in months, you’ve already influenced me and changed me in a positive way. It may not be an exaggeration to say that you’ve become one of my biggest dreams. For me, if one day I can become even one-tenth of the person you are, that would already be a great success in my life.\n\nThank you for becoming a new source of energy in my life, a lot of positive sunshine that gave me more confidence. You are truly wonderful, so please believe in yourself and don’t overthink too much. No matter what, there will always be a small heart in Vietnam quietly supporting you and cheering you on in your future journey and all your upcoming projects. Being your fan is a precious gift that life has given me. \n\nSo p’Kao, please don’t retire too early. I just found you, and I still need you to update the gold price every day.\n\nLove p’Kao so much, 爱你 ❤️\n\nMango from Vietnam with love" },
    { from: "ichaseko", msg: "Xin chao Janeeyeh,\n\nI’ve wanted to write to you for some time now, so here I am. I guess I just want to say this first — I truly appreciate you so much.\n\nActually, I knew you even before Love Design was released. I followed your Instagram back then, but I didn’t really follow your works or dramas closely. After finishing Love Design, I realized how much I regretted it — it felt like I had missed such a precious gem for far too long.\n\nThere were only two scenes in Love Design that made me cry, and both of them were Rin’s scenes — yours. That alone says so much. I was genuinely, deeply impressed by your acting. You are really, really good, Janeeyeh.\n\nI also watched some of your previous works and performances with your group. You dance so well, and you sing beautifully too. Your vocal tone is very lovely and gentle, so I really hope you can trust yourself more and be more confident — because you truly are talented.\n\nFrom everything I see, I can feel that you’re someone who is very professional and sincere about your work. The way you work hard, the way you cherish your fans, and your mindset — all of it feels so genuine. I can’t help but feel a little sad that I didn’t discover such a shining and beautiful gem like you earlier.\n\nRecently, I’ve started revisiting Chinese as well, and honestly, you inspired me to do that, Janeeyeh. So I want to say:\n\n我知道你现在的工作真的很忙，也一直在为自己的梦想努力生活着。\n\n但是Janeeyeh，身体健康也同样重要。\n\n要好好吃饭，睡得充足，也要记得好好休息。\n\n我知道你要入伍了🤓，但也一定要照顾好自己，知道吗？\n\n你真的已经很瘦了，Janeeyeh.\n\n I truly cherish you so much, Janeeyeh. No matter what, there will always be a small girl in Vietnam who quietly supports you and cheers you on through your journey and all your future projects.\n\n爱你，Janeeyeh. 🐱\n\nMango from Vietnam with love" },
    { from: "Iris9779s", msg: "Hello Kao & Jane,\n\nI’m a fan of yours from Vietnam — though that’s not entirely accurate, since I’m currently living and working in the U.S. Even though the physical distance between us is quite far, the feelings I have for you are always very close and very real.\n\nI wasn’t able to attend the recent fan meeting in Thailand. The distance was too far and the circumstances didn’t allow it, and that honestly made me feel so regretful. I thought about it for a long time — wishing I could be there, see you both in person, and say hello directly. Just imagining it already makes my heart flutter.\n\nYou are the very first idols in my life. Before this, I never really understood why people could love idols so deeply, or why being a fan could mean so much to someone. But ever since I got to know you, I finally understood everything.\n\nMeeting you — even if only through a screen — gave me such a special feeling: warmth, gentleness, peace, and happiness. You feel like a quiet but steady source of positive energy, always there to give me strength on my most exhausting days. Since getting to know Kao & Jane, I feel like I’ve changed so much in a good way. It’s like I’ve “unlocked” so many new skills, emotions, and even a confidence I never had before.\n\nThere are days when work feels overwhelming, but just seeing you smile, or seeing you walk alongside each other, makes everything feel so much lighter. You’re not just idols to me — you’re a very important source of emotional support.\n\nI’m truly grateful to you both. Thank you for always doing your best, for giving us so many beautiful moments, and for walking this path together with such sincerity and consistency.\n\nThis Christmas, I wish you both a peaceful, warm, and joyful holiday together. I hope you’re always happy when you’re by each other’s side. And please, don’t overwork yourselves.\n\nWe — the 9779s — worry about you a lot. Lately, you both seem to have lost quite a bit of weight. As fans, what we wish for the most isn’t just to see you active, but to see you healthy, well-rested, and taking good care of yourselves. Your health will always be the most important thing to us.\n\nLastly, please allow me to say this from the bottom of my heart:\n\nI love you both so much.\n\nI hope you’ll always hold hands and walk far, far together on the road ahead. No matter where I am, even if I haven’t met you in person yet, I’ll always be here — watching over you and supporting you with all the sincerity of a fan." },
    { from: "Mmiu_9779s", msg: "Dear P’Kao & P’Janeeyeh,\n\nI’m writing these words to say thank you for your presence in my life.\n\nI’m a young audience member who once went through a period of feeling lost and empty. There were times when I felt like I had almost no motivation left to keep moving forward. By chance, I watched Love Design, and from the very first scenes, I was drawn in by your sincere acting. But later on, I realized that what truly touched my heart and made me stay wasn’t just the series itself — it was your real-life stories and who you are off-screen.\n\nP’Kao, as I learned more about you, I felt deeply moved and truly admired the quiet strength you carry while facing difficulties in your career and fighting illness. Even though you rarely talk about your pain, I can imagine how hard those days must have been — dealing with uterine fibroids, repeated blood transfusions, and intense physical pain. Yet none of that broke you. \n\nYou faced everything calmly, continued living and working without complaints, always carrying that gentle smile. You stay devoted to acting and cherish even the smallest moments with your family, friends, and beloved pets. Your strength isn’t loud or dramatic — it’s a quiet resilience, a steady determination to keep moving forward, even when the steps are slow. I remember you once shared that every time you step onto a set, you feel happy and grateful for the people around you.\n\nYou taught me that being strong doesn’t mean never feeling pain. No matter how harsh life can be, if we hold onto our smiles, nurture optimism, and remain kind to a world that isn’t always gentle, we can overcome anything.\n\nP’Janeeyeh, your story has also been a huge source of inspiration for me. Not everyone has the courage to let go of what’s familiar — especially when it once felt safe and comforting. I truly admire your bravery in stepping out of your comfort zone, a place you had stayed in for so long, to face yourself and the wider world, and to pursue a freer, more mature path.\n\nI know that decision wasn’t easy. It required deep trust and confidence in yourself. You chose to move forward, embrace new challenges, and keep learning. Watching you become calmer and more confident over time, I believe every step you took opened up precious experiences for you. Through you, I learned that growing up sometimes means accepting fear — but still choosing to walk forward because it’s the path you believe in. We need courage to change, so we can discover new strength within ourselves.\n\nWhen I see the two of you together, I learn that life doesn’t always have to be perfect or certain. Everyone walks their own path, and even the smallest steps hold meaning. Though you each shine in different ways, you both give me strength and faith.\n\nWhenever I face difficulties or feel lost, I think about what you’ve been through. Your resilience in both life and career feels like a gentle reminder telling me, “You’ll be okay too.” I believe that as long as I stay true to myself, brave enough to face things, and patient enough to heal step by step, I’ll make it through. These lessons have quietly given me strength during my most uncertain days.\n\nI read and treasure every message you share, and I truly believe that the feelings I have for you — even if simple — will stay with me for a very long time.\n\nI used to be a fan of Taeyeon (SNSD) and Rosé (BLACKPINK), but my connection with you feels very special. You hold a unique place in my heart — not loud, not overwhelming, just a warm presence that lasts. Because of you, my heart has been healed, and I’ve found my faith again.\n\nI hope you’ll always keep that calmness and inner strength, and continue shining in your own unique ways. I wish you both good health, peace, and the courage to keep walking the path you’ve chosen — the one you truly believe in.\n\nThank you for appearing in my life so gently. No matter how my life changes, I promise I’ll always be here, watching over you and supporting you.\n\nWith love,\nA small fan who truly loves you both 💙" },

It might have been a look, a smile, or a quiet moment that stayed with me longer than I expected. But before I knew it, following your journey became something I looked forward to — a small happiness in my everyday life.\n\nThrough every scene, every interaction, and every shared moment,\nyou gave us something more than just a story. You gave us comfort. You gave us the feeling of being understood, of being seen. There were moments that made me smile without realizing it,\nand moments that made my heart ache in the most beautiful way.\n\nWhat makes KaoJane special isn’t just chemistry on screen. It’s the warmth, the sincerity, and the way your connection feels real — like something built on trust, respect, and care. That’s why every memory with you feels worth keeping.\n\nThis Christmas, I don't wish for anything big. I just wish for you to stay healthy, happy, and surrounded by love. May every step you take from now on be filled with confidence,\nand may you continue to shine in your own way — together or apart,\nbut always true to yourselves.\n\nThank you for being a part of my memories.

    { from: "Vy L", msg: "Hi Kao and Jane, \n\nI’m a Vietnamese fan of yours, currently living in the US. Thank you for giving us this fantastic series and for sharing all the unforgettable moments between you two. This year wouldn’t be complete without you two. I’m so glad that I got to know 9779 and become your fan. You two become my daily dopamine pills just by interacting with us and making us feel connected to you. I’ve never connected with any idols like the way I did with you two. Every content and interaction between you two makes me feel at peace and full-hearted. You made me feel a genuine connection from the heart and a closeness like that of a mentor and an older sister. This year has been an up-and-down year for me, where there are times that I have had lots of self-doubt and don’t know if what I’m doing right now is right or not. There are times when I overwork and feel so burned out that I don't want to interact with anyone else. When I knew you two and saw your interviews about self-worth, you kept on fighting until all the energy ran out. I realized that there are no rights or wrongs in choosing a path for our lives, but what matters is how we decide to get back up to keep going. You two slowly become part of my everyday routine, and it’s just so fun to watch you interact. Whenever I watched you two, I always felt the emotional connection and the unconditional support between you. Seeing you two become each other's backbone touched my heart, and your love for each other flows so easily. Especially when I saw your non-seeing side, only shown to each other. It feels like the connections you two have are full of love and affection, and whenever I see you two together, laughing happily, it sends a heartwarming energy to me. You two are my daily reminder that it’s important to love ourselves, and then, at the right time, the right person will come along. I’ve never believed in red string theory until I saw you two together. Your story just felt like the series, but the connection is even deeper than that. It’s like you two are the missing pieces that the other needs. Thank you for finding each other and creating this amazing series for us. I hope that I’ll always see this carefree and joyful side of yours whenever you’re with one another. Thank you for becoming my inspiration and daily happiness. I hope next year will be a year full of love and success for you two. Merry Christmas, I hope you two have an amazing Fan-sign and New Year.\n\nWishes Kao and Jane 1314 and inseparable love." },
    { from: "Haymua", msg: "Dear Kao & Janeeyeh\n\nI wanted to take a moment to share a personal thought with you today.\nI have been a fan of Kao for a long time, starting from the Hormones era, and now following your new journey into the Girls’ Love (GL) series. Your recent shares and projects have truly resonated with me on a deep level.\nI am also in a long-term same-sex relationship (GL) that is nearly 8 years strong. My girlfriend and I are both outwardly feminine, and our relationship wasn't a case of \"love at first sight.\" We started as colleagues, then became friends, and gradually, feelings developed. I was the one who confessed first, and I was initially rejected because she had only dated men before me. However, with persistence and sincerity—the idea of \"slow drip through the roof soaks the ground\"—we finally came together and built a lasting love.\nSimilar to the genuine difference and truth I feel in your GL portrayal, I truly believe that love is the hardest thing in the world to explain. My relationship has had its share of arguments and difficulties, but we always take the initiative to reconcile, support, and stay by each other's side through every up and down, both financially and emotionally.\nI’ve learned one important lesson: Long-term love is not just a fairy tale. It means loving their bad habits too, offering empathy, sharing, and growing together in a positive direction. The most crucial part is that when we are together, we feel Safe - Happy - and Healed.\nI see my younger self reflected in the sincerity you are currently embodying. I hope your projects continue to bring forth authentic love stories, spreading positivity and healing to many people.\nI wish you continued passion, happiness, and success in your artistic path! \nWith all my love and endless support,\nWishing you a warm and wonderful Christmas!\nA devoted fan" },
    { from: "An", msg: "Hi Kao & Jane!\n\nI’m a fan from Vietnam. Before this, I’d never really been into shipping couples — my life was just family, work, and my pets. I used to wonder how someone could be so affected by people they didn’t even know… and now I realize I was wrong. Not just one person — but two of you.\n\nAt a time when I was struggling between family issues and my ex-relationship, a friend introduced me to Love Design, the very first Thai GL series I’ve ever watched. At first, I only planned to watch a little, just to support my friend’s fangirling.\n\nBut then… karma hit me hard 😭\nI fell into Aokbab and Rin’s love story. I became deeply attached to their relationship — it reminded me so much of my own past love and made me think a lot. And somehow, without even realizing it, I let go of that person I’d been holding onto for so long.\n\nMaybe it’s because the things we can’t have are the ones we treasure the most. That’s why I really love the gentle, respectful love between Aokbab and Rin.\n\nAt first, I thought I only loved the characters in the drama. But as people say, “when you love someone, you love everything about them,” so I slowly started joining fandom trends and supporting in my own way. Then I realized — through all the cute moments and interactions between you two — that I had also fallen for Kao & Jane’s personalities and energy without even noticing 🥰\n\nYou helped me forget the struggles out there, and became a source of inspiration for me to start again. I’ve only been in the fandom for a little over a month, but I can already feel how much I’ve changed.\n\nThank you both for being such an endless source of inspiration in my life.\nMost of all, your interactions are just so adorable — they always make me smile without realizing it 🤭 Even just thinking about you makes me smile.\n\nThank you for bringing so much positivity and love back into my life." },

That light has given me the strength to keep going and to pick up the things I once left unfinished.\nWe V-9779s will always support you and feel proud of everything you do." },

Sometimes, all you need to do is live fully in the present and the right possibility will find its way to you.\n\nIf you ever doubt yourself, remember this: you didn’t get here by luck. You got here through countless small, brave choices. Among those million possibilities, at least one believes in you more than you do right now.\nGive yourself time.\nGive the future a chance to unfold in ways you’ve never imagined.\nYou are not alone among endless possibilities.\nYou are one of the most beautiful ones.\nAnd before looking ahead, let us pause for a moment and say to ourselves:\nThank you for trying.\nThank you for not giving up, even when results weren’t visible.\nThank you for moving forward, even without knowing what awaited you.\nThank you for being here with us.\n\nTo Jane\nWishing you a life where every step blooms.\nEven when the road ahead feels uneven or quiet, may each step you take quietly grow into something good. There’s no need to rush into full bloom, small flowers are enough, as long as they grow from trust, kindness, and love.\nMay you walk through storms without losing softness and pass through darkness while keeping light in your eyes. No matter how the world changes, may your heart remain gentle, still moved by simple things.\nIf one day you feel tired, remember: flowers don’t bloom because they’re pushed, they bloom when the season arrives. As long as you keep walking, the road will bloom for you.\nWishing you a life of calm grace, where looking back, you see flowers,\nand looking up, you see blue skies.\n\nTo JaneKaoKaoJane\nSome people don’t arrive early or late, they arrive exactly on time.\nIf you’ve ever wondered why you had to pass through so many lonely cycles, perhaps it was to prepare you for a meeting strong enough to last.\nMeeting the right person means you don’t have to prove yourself or become someone else. You can simply be who you are and still be understood. You can stay silent and feel safe.\nIf you haven’t met that person yet, don’t be sad. The most beautiful encounters are never rushed. They come when we’ve learned what we need to learn, and when we’re gentle enough to receive them.\nWishing you that one ordinary day\nwhen you meet someone who feels exactly right,\nto walk forward together, lighter, warmer, and no longer lost.\n\nOn days that feel heavy, I hope you still keep a little sweetness for yourself.\nIt doesn’t have to be a big joy or something perfect, just a moment gentle enough for your heart to slow down. A calm morning, a song that fits your mood, a message arriving when you thought no one remembered.\nThese small things may not change life immediately, but they remind us that warmth still exists.\nIf today you’re not as strong as you wish, that’s okay. Sweetness is never loud, it stays quietly, waiting for you to return to yourself. As long as you haven’t let go of hope, a little sweetness is still nearby.\n\nAllow yourself to slow down.\nLet your scars rest.\nAnd trust that, in the end, life will still offer you kindness in its own way.\n\nWishing you days filled with just enough sweetness\nto keep going,\nto smile,\nand to love life a little more." },

    { from: "dweulike", msg: "Dear Kao and Jane,\n\nI first got to know you through the Thai series Love Design. Although you have been loved for a long time, I'm sorry that it took me so long to discover you, as I hadn't been following Thai entertainment before. After finishing the series, I couldn't help but fall in love with both of you. Not only because of your beautiful visuals, but also because your acting felt so natural, sincere, and full of feeling. As I learned more about you, I grew even more fond of you. Your personalities, mindsets, and inner strength are truly admirable. The more I know, the more I feel that you are meant to stand side by side.\n\nP'Kao, even after achieving success and recognition, what touches me most is your respect for your work and the people around you. I appreciate how sincerely you express care and encouragement, and your wish to walk alongside Jane and support her is something genuinely beautiful. You are always smiling, gentle, and kind, but behind that smile is a quiet strength shaped by difficult times. It feels like you are living a life you are deeply content with, understanding yourself and what you really need. I hope you can hold on to this mindset for a long time, and that your life continues to be filled with joy. Please keep being your funny self on social media. I secretly hope you're just as playful in real life as well.\n\nN'Jane, even though you are younger and have only stepped into acting in recent years, your love for acting shines through every project you take part in. You have won the hearts of the audience, and your achievements feel well deserved. Thank you for trusting yourself and choosing your own path. You trusted yourself, and you were right. You have now clearly shown everyone your true ability. I wish you even more success and confidence in the future. Your personality is one of the things I love the most. You are adorable, humorous, and always know how to make people feel at ease and laugh. I sincerely hope you will always receive the same happiness you give to others.\n\nYour interaction and chemistry together are simply amazing. The way one leads and the other responds feels effortless and genuine. It is natural, sweet, and full of tenderness. No matter what form your relationship takes, I hope you will always feel comfortable working together and walking alongside each other in life. Seeing you support one another already brings happiness to so many of us. Discovering you has been one of the greatest gifts of this year for me, and the gentle, healing energy you share has truly comforted my heart. Thank you for becoming part of my life!\n\nWishing you both a peaceful Christmas and a future filled with light, love, and endless possibilities. ❤️" },
    { from: "Pham Thu Xoan", msg: "To P’Kao and P’Jane,\n\nI only came to know you through Love Design, but I truly grew to love both of you and could deeply feel the sincerity you have for each other and for your fans. The series was truly wonderful and touched my heart in a very special way. It helped me realize that marriage is not a bad thing at all, as long as you meet the right person. I also hope that one day I can experience a beautiful love like Rin and Aokbap’s, even if it comes with many challenges. I wish to be brave enough to express my love just like the way you do. I hope P’Kao and P’Jane will always stay happy and passionate as you are now. May you continue to love, support, and walk alongside each other for a long time, together with 9779s.
